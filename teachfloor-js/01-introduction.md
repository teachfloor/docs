Introduction
Introduction to Teachfloor.js SDK
The Teachfloor.js SDK (referred to simply as the SDK) is a powerful tool that enables seamless integration between your custom web page and the Teachfloor platform. By embedding the SDK into your web page, you can establish a communication channel with Teachfloor, allowing your custom implementation to interact with and respond to the dynamic environment within the Teachfloor application.

This integration opens up a wide range of possibilities, such as accessing user-specific data, listening to environmental changes, and triggering actions within the Teachfloor platform, all from within your custom web page.

Promise-Based Architecture
The Teachfloor.js SDK is built on a promise-based architecture, providing a modern, efficient way to handle asynchronous operations. In a dynamic environment like Teachfloor, many interactions, such as fetching user information or responding to environment changes, occur asynchronously. The promise-based design of the SDK allows developers to manage these asynchronous tasks with ease and clarity.

Integration Capabilities
Once integrated, your custom web page can:

Access Authenticated User Information : Retrieve and utilize details about the currently authenticated user to personalize the experience or control access.

Respond to Environment Changes : Listen for and respond to events such as changes in the Teachfloor environment, enabling dynamic content updates and interaction within your custom page.

With the Teachfloor.js SDK, you can create rich, interactive experiences that seamlessly blend your custom content with the Teachfloor platformâ€™s powerful features. The SDK's promise-based architecture ensures that these interactions are smooth, reliable, and easy to implement.
