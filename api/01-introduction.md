# Introduction
The Teachfloor API is a robust and flexible interface designed to interact seamlessly with the Teachfloor platform. Built on RESTful principles, our API facilitates easy integration by providing predictable, resource-oriented URLs. This design approach ensures that developers can intuitively understand and use the API, making it easier to build applications that connect with Teachfloor's services.

Our API uses standard HTTP methods, ensuring that anyone familiar with RESTful conventions will find it straightforward to work with. Requests to the API accept form-encoded bodies, and responses are returned in JSON format, which is widely used and supported across various programming languages and environments. This consistency ensures that data is easy to parse and manipulate, whether you're working on a web application, mobile app, or backend service.

While the Teachfloor API is designed to be comprehensive and powerful, there are some important considerations to keep in mind:

- **No Bulk Updates**: The API does not support bulk operations. This means that each request is limited to creating, updating, or deleting a single object at a time. While this may require more requests for certain operations, it also simplifies error handling and debugging by isolating issues to individual objects.
